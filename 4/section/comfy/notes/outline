- Start off with a talk of pointers
	- go over the worksheet from CS61

	- go over radix sort

- Memory
	- stack
		- stack.c
		- organization of the stack and how it works (which direction it grows)
	
	- heap

- FILE I/O 
	- change radix.c to take an array from an input file, and print out to an out file.
		- can also be done somewhat easily with redirection

	- helpful functions
		- fread()
		- fwrite()
		- etc

- pset
	- resize.c
	- recover.c
