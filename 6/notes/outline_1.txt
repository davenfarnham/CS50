- HTTP & TCP
  - HTTP: Connectionless. Everytime I send or request a piece of information, I have to 
   	  open up a new connection. 

  - TCP is connected and reliable - if a packet is dropped, it will resend it.

  - talk about the protocol stack and what happens when I request some information from, say, facebook.com
    - facebook's ip: 69.171.230.5

- Make a webpage (HTML + CSS)
	- show video of mr.meeseeks

	- talk about HTML
  	  - the hypertext in the above example is HTML 

	- talk about CSS
	  - it's a way to break up the code, kind of like using functions
	    - # for ids
	    - . for classes
	    - nothing for normal tags

	- chmod
	  - to change the permissions of things
	    - 711 for directories
	    - 644 for everything except PHP files
	    - 600 for php files

	- open up developer tools and network to look at all the connections your webpage is making

- Walk through pset
